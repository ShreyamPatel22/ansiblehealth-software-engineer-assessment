Ansible Health — Software Engineer Assessment

### Overview

This project converts a Markdown meeting note file into a fully formatted Google Doc using the Google Docs API.

Instead of simply pasting text, this tool parses the semantic structure of the Markdown and converts it into the correct formatting in Google Docs, including:

Heading hierarchy (#, ##, ###)

Real bullet lists (not *)

Checkbox-style action items (- [ ])

Colored and bold assignee mentions (e.g., @mike)

Footer metadata (italic and right-aligned)

This demonstrates the ability to work with structured data, external APIs, and text processing to produce a polished internal asset.
